This is an off-the-cuff attempt at a breadcrumb navigation feature.

It's pretty broken, but maybe you can see what I'm trying to do:

- [BreadcrumbNavigation](https://github.com/adamfoneil/StackNav/blob/master/StackNav.Blazor/Services/BreadcrumbNavigation.cs) -- tries to track where you are and gives you a way back to the prior page
- [Index.razor](https://github.com/adamfoneil/StackNav/blob/master/StackNav.Blazor/Pages/Index.razor) sample home page
